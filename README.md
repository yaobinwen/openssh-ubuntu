# openssh-ubuntu

## Overview

This repository contains the versions of OpenSSH source files that I'm interested in and the notes I made for learning purpose. Because I mainly work on Ubuntu, the source code all comes from the [openssh package on Launchpad](https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh). Therefore, the code in this repository belongs to the original authors of `openssh` and should be used under the same license. See their [license](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/tree/LICENCE).

Each version is in its own sub-folder. My notes are all marked with `NOTE(ywen)`.
